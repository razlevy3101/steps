* Install the requirements using pip.
* This code is using local MogoDB.
* Use "flask run" to start the server.

~ Timing (or- how much time i spent while working on this task) ~
* about 1 hour - getting to know flask and create a template for the server
* 2.5 hours - download and play-around with SQLite. After a lot of dead time due to a problem unsolved (google wasn’t very helpful) i decided to move to MongoDB.
* 1 hour - managed to install and have a primary working POST func with access to db
* 2.5 hours - write (almost) all functions. Almost- because i didn’t implement the /posts as pagination.
* 20 minutes - convert posts to pagination logic
* 30 minutes - finalizing the code



~ Notes ~
* Regarding the timing implementation: it could have been done locally, without the DB. However, i think this way is better when wanting to cope with a lot of data later on.
